LMS = Learning Management System

Backend only talks with cloudinary and back and forth, 
front end is not involved.

We will be designing a Secure LMS with payment gateway

Stripe or Razorpay 

Payment gateway interacts with Backend

but its the only thing that is available on the frontend part too
When you click on pay now info is being sent to Backend

We will learn only about how backend will talk to payment gateway 

basic setup -> models -> controllers -> route -> middleware -> utilities (multer) 
Security (IMP) ENV important.

RBAC -> Role based Access Control middleware stuff.
