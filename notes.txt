LMS = Learning Management System

Backend only talks with cloudinary and back and forth, 
front end is not involved.

We will be designing a Secure LMS with payment gateway

Stripe or Razorpay 

Payment gateway interacts with Backend

// web security vulnerability where an attacker sends multiple HTTP parameters with the same name in a single request, 
//exploiting inconsistencies in how web servers and applications handle duplicate parameters

//Attackers supply duplicate parameters (e.g., ?user=alice&user=bob) in HTTP GET or POST requests

XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) is a web security vulnerability that allows attackers to
