LMS = Learning Management System

Backend only talks with cloudinary and back and forth, 
front end is not involved.

We will be designing a Secure LMS with payment gateway

Stripe or Razorpay 

Payment gateway interacts with Backend

but its the only thing that is available on the frontend part too
When you click on pay now info is being sent to Backend

We will learn only about how backend will talk to payment gateway 

basic setup -> models -> controllers -> route -> middleware -> utilities (multer) 
Security (IMP) ENV important.

RBAC -> Role based Access Control middleware stuff.

npm uninstall express 
//how to uninstall something 

app.use in inbuilt middleware so you have to use it

cybersecurity time 
express.rate.limit

if someone is trying to ddos limit repeated requests to public APIs

helmet (headers can be disabled, prevents some headers to be even sent)

mongoose santizer helps you sanitze the express request parameters like
queries params and body and headers based on Mongoose schema tree

//avoids sql injections

hpp package

HTTP Parameter Pollution
// web security vulnerability where an attacker sends multiple HTTP parameters with the same name in a single request, 
//exploiting inconsistencies in how web servers and applications handle duplicate parameters

//Attackers supply duplicate parameters (e.g., ?user=alice&user=bob) in HTTP GET or POST requests

XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) is a web security vulnerability that allows attackers to 
inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

which parses cookies attached to incoming HTTP requests and makes 
them easily accessible as JavaScript objects on req.cookies

CORS for cross origin request you need to know where the external requests are coming from
it can be of different port and origin

Imagine a payment gateway scenario where the user clicks a "Pay Now" button,
 enters their confidential details, and Razorpay or Stripe 
 handles the transaction securely in the background. Our own route, 
 like the /order route, sends the necessary data and keys to their 
 backend, and they communicate with the bank, then return the payment
  status to us.

  BRAIN TREE DIAGRAM PAYPAL

  front end -> token backend server -> 

  razorpay_signature has to be created. that is created by order ID 
  to match it later 

  script from razorpay end:  checkout.razorpay.com/v1/checkout.js
